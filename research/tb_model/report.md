# ATR-barrier study: S1 screen (2026-10-17)

Pre-registration `preregistration.json` (69d250ae). Arms: cs_tba (ARO on 037 tbatr, volume > 0, 24
inputs), cs_tbb (+ 7 composite inputs). S1 pass = candidate-bar tbatr AUC above ARO's in both halves.

| Median over folds | composite | ARO | cs_tba | cs_tbb |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| candidate AUC early | 0.554 | 0.541 | 0.503 | 0.492 |
| candidate AUC late | 0.552 | 0.539 | 0.523 | 0.525 |
| candidate MCC early | — | 0.007 | −0.003 | 0.006 |
| candidate MCC late | — | 0.004 | 0.057 | 0.064 |
| all-bar AUC early / late | — | 0.518 / 0.497 | 0.497 / 0.505 | 0.493 / 0.510 |

**S1: both arms FAIL; no backtests run.** B > A in both halves: no.

Diagnostic (not part of the gate): both models output near-constant p_buy (mean ≈ 0.36, sd ≈ 0.035,
max ≈ 0.44, e.g. f02 and f13), so they sit near the base rate rather than learning the label. cs_tbb
has the composite's inputs yet scores below the composite's fixed equal-weight readout (0.49 vs 0.55
early), which points at training, not at the inputs. Late folds f12/f13 do reach 0.55–0.61.
